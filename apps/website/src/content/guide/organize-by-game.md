title: Auto-organize OBS recordings by game
description: A companion OBS Lua script that sorts recordings, replays, and screenshots into per-game folders QlipQ reads automatically.
order: 3
---

OBS writes every recording into one flat folder. **QlipQRenamer** is an optional companion script that sorts each finished recording, saved replay, and screenshot into a folder named after the game you were capturing — the same per-game layout NVIDIA ShadowPlay uses, and one QlipQ already understands. It runs on the LuaJIT runtime bundled with OBS, so there is no Python to install.

> Based on the [original OBS Studio script](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/recorder.1926/) by **oxypatic**, reimplemented in Lua. All credit for the original idea goes to its author.

## 1. Install the script

1. Download [`qlipq-renamer.lua`](/qlipq-renamer.lua).
2. In OBS, open **Tools → Scripts**.
3. On the **Lua Scripts** tab, click **+** and select `qlipq-renamer.lua`.

Requires OBS 28 or newer. Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Unlike the original Python script, this uses the Lua runtime OBS already ships with — nothing else to install.

## 2. Configure it

The script reads the game from your scene's **Game Capture** (or **Window Capture**) source, then files clips into subfolders of your existing recording folder. Open it under **Tools → Scripts → qlipq-renamer.lua** to set:

| Setting                              | Default         | What it does                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fallback folder name                 | `Any Recording` | Where clips go when no app is detected (e.g. desktop screenshots).        |
| Organization mode                    | Folder per game | Optionally add a `yy-mm-dd` date subfolder under each game.               |
| Move clips into per-game folders     | On              | Turn off to leave files where OBS put them (e.g. metadata-only).          |
| Prefix filenames with the game title | Off             | Names files `Game - <original>` so the game also travels in the filename. |
| Write game name into file metadata   | Off             | Embeds a `game=` tag with ffmpeg (stream copy). See below.                |
| ffmpeg path (for metadata)           | `ffmpeg`        | Full path if ffmpeg isn't on `PATH`. Only used when the tag option is on. |
| Organize replay-buffer saves         | On              | Organize saved replays too; turn off to leave them where OBS put them.    |
| Replay subfolder name                | _(none)_        | Empty (default) = replays go straight in the game folder.                 |
| Organize screenshots                 | On              | Screenshots go under a `screenshot` subfolder.                            |
| Screenshot subfolder name            | `screenshot`    | Name of that subfolder.                                                   |

**Folders vs. metadata are independent.** You can move into folders, embed the game as a `game=` metadata tag, both, or neither — whatever suits your workflow. The metadata tag uses ffmpeg to stream-copy the file (no re-encode); **mkv** stores it most reliably (mp4's metadata support is limited), and on Windows it briefly flashes a console window per clip. qlipq already writes this same `game=` tag when you export, so the metadata option is mainly for tagging the original recordings.

> The capture source must be **visible** in your current scene for the script to read the hooked game. Keep your Game/Window Capture source enabled.

> **Using Display Capture?** On **Windows**, when no Game/Window Capture identifies the app, the script falls back to the **focused window** — so whole-monitor recordings still sort by game. (It skips the OBS window and the desktop, and a Game/Window Capture always takes priority.) On macOS/Linux this fallback isn't available, so Display Capture clips use the fallback folder.

## 3. What the folders look like

Say OBS records into `D:\Clips`. Before the script, everything piles up in one place:

```text
D:\Clips\
├─ 2026-06-30 21-14-02.mkv
├─ 2026-06-30 21-55-40.mkv
├─ Replay 2026-06-30 22-03-11.mkv
└─ 2026-06-30 22-10-00.png
```

With the script running, each file lands under the game that was hooked when it was captured:

```text
D:\Clips\
├─ Apex Legends\
│  ├─ 2026-06-30 21-14-02.mkv
│  └─ Replay 2026-06-30 22-03-11.mkv
├─ Counter Strike 2\
│  └─ 2026-06-30 21-55-40.mkv
└─ Any Recording\
   └─ screenshot\
      └─ 2026-06-30 22-10-00.png
```

(The screenshot was taken on the desktop with no game hooked, so it went to the **fallback** folder.)

Switch **Organization mode** to **Folder per game, then date** to add a daily subfolder:

```text
D:\Clips\Apex Legends\26-06-30\2026-06-30 21-14-02.mkv
```

## 4. Let QlipQ read the organized clips

QlipQ scans each watched folder **including subfolders**, so the tidied clips still land in your queue. It also recovers the **game name** and surfaces it as the `{source}` token in your [naming template](/guide/getting-started). The script can drive that two ways:

- **From the folder.** When a clip sits in a per-game subfolder under a watched folder — exactly what this script creates — QlipQ uses that folder name as the source, the same convention it reads from NVIDIA Share. Just add your OBS recording folder under **Settings → Watched folders** (QlipQ can auto-detect it). In the example above, the queue shows the two `.mkv` clips with `{source}` = _Apex Legends_ and _Counter Strike 2_.
- **From the filename.** Turn on **Prefix filenames with the game title** and the script names files `Apex Legends - 2026-06-30 21-14-02.mkv`. QlipQ reads the leading label as the source, so the game name rides along even if the clip is later moved out of its folder.

A filename label takes precedence over the folder when both are present, so it is safe to use either or both.

> This is the same `{source}` covered in [OBS replay buffer setup](/guide/obs-replay-buffer) — the script is just a hands-off way to fill it without editing OBS's filename format yourself.

## 5. Recommended setup

For a clean capture-to-clip pipeline:

1. Set OBS to record in **mkv** and, ideally, run the **replay buffer** — see [OBS replay buffer setup](/guide/obs-replay-buffer).
2. Load `qlipq-renamer.lua` and leave the defaults (per-game folders; replays and screenshots organized).
3. In QlipQ, add your OBS recording folder under **Settings → Watched folders**.
4. That's it: press your save-replay hotkey mid-game, the script files the clip under the game, and QlipQ queues it with the game already set as `{source}`.

Prefer the game name baked into the filenames (e.g. you sync clips elsewhere)? Also enable **Prefix filenames with the game title**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Clips land in "Any Recording."** No app was detected at capture time. Make sure your **Game Capture** (or **Window Capture**) source is in the current scene, visible, and actually capturing. On **macOS/Linux**, **Display Capture** can't report a game, so those clips always use the fallback folder.
- **The game folder name looks stripped** (e.g. _Tom Clancys Rainbow Six Siege_). Titles are reduced to letters, numbers, and spaces, so punctuation like `:`, `®`, or `'` is removed — matching how the original script names folders.
- **A split recording wasn't fully sorted.** With OBS automatic file splitting, only the **final** segment is moved; earlier segments stay in the root folder.
- **Nothing moved at all.** The script acts when a file is finalized — **Recording Stopped**, **Replay Buffer Saved**, or **Screenshot Taken** — not while recording is still running.

## What it covers (and what it doesn't)

The script files the **final** recording on stop, every saved replay, and every screenshot. It does **not** split-handle OBS automatic file-splitting mid-recording (only the last segment is sorted), and it tracks the capture source in your **current scene** (sources nested inside sub-scenes are not traversed).

**Next:** [point QlipQ at your recording folder](/guide/getting-started).
